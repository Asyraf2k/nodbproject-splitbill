# Split Bill - Trial Application

The **Split Bill** application is a simple app designed to help split a bill among multiple people. This application does not use a database but instead stores data temporarily in a JSON file. The app is built using **Next.js** for the backend and **PHP** for the frontend.

## Features

- **Add Data**: Add individuals to split the bill (name, age).
- **View Data**: Display the list of people and their details.
- **Delete Data**: Remove individuals from the list.
- **No Database**: Data is stored in a `database.json` file for trial purposes.

## Application Architecture

- **Backend**: Built with **Next.js** providing an API to handle data operations (GET, POST, DELETE).
- **Frontend**: Uses **PHP** to display data and make requests to the Next.js backend.

- **Node.js** (for running Next.js)
- **PHP** (for running frontend)
